ngrab
========

ngrab is a really awesome script that can help you out when you have to export like 100 .nessus files that are all in a nessus 'folder'. Sometimes you need to split these scans up for some reason and end up having a folder full of about 100 different 'scans'. This can be a massive pain in the arse as nessus doesn't let you export them all en-mass.

enter ngrab.py
